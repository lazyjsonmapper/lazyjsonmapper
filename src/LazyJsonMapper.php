/**
 * Advanced, intelligent & automatic object-oriented JSON containers for PHP.
 *
 * Implements a highly efficient, automatic, object-oriented and lightweight
 * (memory-wise) JSON data container. It provides intelligent data conversion
 * and parsing, to give you a nice, reliable interface to your JSON data,
 * without having to worry about doing any of the tedious parsing yourself.
 *
 * Features:
 *
 *  - Provides a completely object-oriented interface to all of your JSON data.
 *
 *  - Automatically maps complex, nested JSON data structures onto real PHP
 *    objects, with total support for nested objects and multi-level arrays.
 *
 *  - Extremely optimized for very high performance and very low memory usage.
 *    Much lower than other PHP JSON mappers that people have used in the past.
 *
 *    For example, normal PHP objects with manually defined `$properties`, which
 *    is what's used by _other_ JSON mappers, will consume memory for every
 *    property even if that property wasn't in the JSON data (is a `NULL`). Our
 *    system on the other hand takes up ZERO bytes of RAM for any properties
 *    that don't exist in the current object's JSON data!
 *
 *  - Automatically provides "direct virtual properties", which lets you
 *    interact with the JSON data as if it were regular object properties,
 *    such as `echo $item->some_value` and `$item->some_value = 'foo'`.
 *
 *    The virtual properties can be disabled via an option.
 *
 *  - Automatically provides object-oriented "virtual functions", which let you
 *    interact with the data in a fully object-oriented way via functions such
 *    as `$item->getSomeValue()` and `$item->setSomeValue('foo')`. We support a
 *    large range of different functions for manipulating the JSON data, and you
 *    can see a list of all available function names for all of your properties
 *    by simply running `$item->printPropertyDescriptions()`.
 *
 *    The virtual functions can be disabled via an option.
 *
 *  - Includes the `LazyDoctor` tool, which _automatically_ documents all of
 *    your `LazyJsonMapper`-based classes so that their virtual properties and
 *    functions become _fully_ visible to your IDE and to various intelligent
 *    code analysis tools. It also performs class diagnostics by compiling all
 *    of your class property maps, which means that you can be 100% sure that
 *    all of your maps are valid (compilable) if this tool runs successfully.
 *
 *  - We provide a complete, internal API which your subclasses can use to
 *    interact with the data inside of the JSON container. This allows you to
 *    easily override the automatic functions or create additional functions
 *    for your objects. To override core functions, just define a function with
 *    the exact same name on your object and make it do whatever you want to.
 *
 *    Here are some examples of function overriding:
 *
 *      ```php
 *      public function getFoo()
 *      {
 *          // try to read property, and handle a special "current_time" value.
 *          $value = $this->_getProperty('foo');
 *          if ($value === 'current_time') { return time(); }
 *          return $value;
 *      }
 *      public function setFoo(
 *          $value)
 *      {
 *          // if they try to set value to "md5", use a special value instead.
 *          if ($value === 'md5') { $value = md5(time()); }
 *          return $this->_setProperty('foo', $value);
 *      }
 *      ```
 *
 *  - All mapping/data conversion is done "lazily", on a per-property basis.
 *    When you access a property, that specific property is mapped/converted to
 *    the proper type as defined by your class property map. No time or memory
 *    is wasted converting properties that you never touch.
 *
 *  - Strong type-system. The class property map controls the exact types and
 *    array depths. You can fully trust that the data you get/set will match
 *    your specifications. Invalid data that mismatches the spec is impossible.
 *
 *  - Advanced settings system. Everything is easily configured via PHP class
 *    constants, which means that your class-settings are stateless (there's no
 *    need for any special "settings/mapper object" to keep track of settings),
 *    and that all settings are immutable constants (which means that they are
 *    reliable and can never mutate at runtime, so that you can fully trust that
 *    classes will always behave as-defined in their code).
 *
 *    If you want to override multiple core settings identically for all of your
 *    classes, then simply create a subclass of `LazyJsonMapper` and configure
 *    all of your settings on that, and then derive all of your other classes
 *    from your re-configured subclass!
 *
 *  - The world's most advanced mapper definition system. Your class property
 *    maps are defined in an easy PHPdoc-style format, and support multilevel
 *    arrays (such as `int[][]` for "an array of arrays of ints"), relative
 *    types (so you can map properties to classes/objects that are relative to
 *    the namespace of the class property map), parent inheritance (all of your
 *    parent `extends`-hierarchy's maps will be included in your final property
 *    map) and even multiple inheritance (you can literally "import" an infinite
 *    number of other maps into your class, which don't come from your own
 *    parent `extends`-hierarchy).
 *
 *  - Inheriting properties from parent classes or importing properties from
 *    other classes is a zero-cost operation thanks to how efficient our
 *    property map compiler is. So feel free to import everything you need.
 *    You can even use this system to create importable classes that just hold
 *    "collections" of shared properties, which you import into other classes.
 *
 *  - The class property maps are compiled a single time per-class at runtime,
 *    the first time a class is used. The compilation process fully verifies
 *    and compiles all property definitions, all parent maps, all inherited
 *    maps, and all maps of all classes you link properties to.
 *
 *    If there are any compilation problems due to a badly written map anywhere
 *    in your hierarchy, you will be shown the exact problem in great detail.
 *
 *    In case of success, the compiled and verified maps are all stored in an
 *    incredibly memory-efficient format in a global cache which is shared by
 *    your whole PHP runtime, which means that anything in your code or in any
 *    other libraries which accesses the same classes will all share the cached
 *    compilations of those classes, for maximum memory efficiency.
 *
 *  - You are also able to access JSON properties that haven't been defined in
 *    the class property map. In that case, they are treated as undefined and
 *    untyped (`mixed`) and there won't be any automatic type-conversion of such
 *    properties, but it can still be handy in a pinch.
 *
 *  - There are lots of data export/output options for your object's JSON data,
 *    to get it back out of the object again: As a multi-level array, as nested
 *    stdClass objects, or as a JSON string representation of your object.
 *
 *  - We include a whole assortment of incredibly advanced debugging features:
 *
 *    You can run the constructor with `$requireAnalysis` to ensure that all
 *    of your JSON data is successfully mapped according to your class property
 *    map, and that you haven't missed defining any properties that exist in the
 *    data. In case of any problems, the analysis message will give you a full
 *    list of all problems encountered in your entire JSON data hierarchy.
 *
 *    For your class property maps themselves, you can run functions such as
 *    `printPropertyDescriptions()` to see a complete list of all properties and
 *    how they are defined. This helps debug your class inheritance and imports
 *    to visually see what your final class map looks like, and it also helps
 *    users see all available properties and all of their virtual functions.
 *
 *    And for the JSON data, you can use functions such as `printJson()` to get
 *    a beautiful view of all internal JSON data, which is incredibly helpful
 *    when you (or your users) need to figure out what's available inside the
 *    current object instance's data storage.
 *
 *  - A fine-grained and logical exception-system which ensures that you can
 *    always trust the behavior of your objects and can catch problems easily.
 *    And everything we throw is _always_ based on `LazyJsonMapperException`,
 *    which means that you can simply catch that single "root" exception
 *    whenever you don't care about fine-grained differentiation.
 *
 *  - Clean and modular code ensures stability and future extensibility.
 *
 *  - Deep code documentation explains everything you could ever wonder about.
 *
 *  - Lastly, we implement super-efficient object serialization. Everything is
 *    stored in a tightly packed format which minimizes data size when you need
 *    to transfer your objects between runtimes.

    const ALLOW_VIRTUAL_FUNCTIONS = true;

    /**
     * Whether we should cache all magic virtual function translations.
     *
     * This constant can be overridden in your subclasses to toggle caching.
     *
     * The cache stores all of the current runtime's encountered magic/virtual
     * function name translations, such as `SomeProperty` (via `getSomeProperty`
     * and `setSomeProperty`, etc) and the fact that it refers to a JSON
     * property that will be named either `some_property` (if snake style)
     * or `someProperty` (if camel style).
     *
     * Entries are added to the cache one-by-one every time you call a function
     * on an uncached property name for the first time. The next time you call a
     * function which accesses the same property name, then there's no need to
     * analyze the function name again (to figure out what JSON data property it
     * refers to), since the translation is already cached. It is cached on a
     * per-property name basis. So a SINGLE cached translation of `SomeProperty`
     * will be shared by ALL function calls related to that property (such as
     * all of the core functions; `hasSomeProperty`, `isSomeProperty`,
     * `getSomeProperty`, `setSomeProperty`, and `unsetSomeProperty`).
     *
     * At the cost of a very tiny bit of RAM, this caching greatly speeds up
     * magic function calls so that they only take about 16% as long as they
     * would without the cache. However, they're still very fast even without a
     * cache, and you may be accessing so many different properties that you'd
     * prefer to avoid a cache for memory reasons (if you prefer lower memory
     * needs over pure speed). The choice is yours.
     *
     * To calculate the memory needs of your own project's virtual function
     * cache, you simply need to know that an average cache entry uses ~248.6
     * bytes of RAM on PHP 7 and ~510.4 bytes on PHP 5. Note that the size per
     * name translation is small enough to be measured in BYTES (NOT kilobytes)!
     *
     * Those averages were calculated from a huge sample-size of 10000 function
     * names, and are very accurate for real-world JSON data.
     *
     * To calculate your own cache memory size, think about how many different
     * JSON properties you'll need to access in your project. Most normal
     * projects would probably only access at most 100 different property names
     * (such as `getComments`, `setTime`, etc), since you most likely won't
     * access every property in the JSON data. So only count the properties
     * you'll access. And also remember that identical property names used
     * across different classes, and all the different functions for accessing
     * the same property, will still only require a SINGLE global cache entry
     * per property name.
     *
     * The storage needs for 100 different property name translations would be
     * as follows. As you can see, the cache is very memory-efficient:
     *
     * - PHP 7: 100x ~248.6 bytes = 24 860 bytes (~24.9 kilobytes).
     * - PHP 5: 100x ~510.4 bytes = 51 040 bytes (~51.1 kilobytes).
     *
     * (If you're still using PHP 5, you should really consider upgrading to
     * PHP 7 with its better memory efficiency and its much faster engine!)
     *
     * It is highly recommended to use caching, and it is enabled by default
     * unless you override the constant in your class, as follows:
     *
     *   ```php
     *   class MyUncachedLazyJsonMapper extends LazyJsonMapper
     *   {
     *       const USE_MAGIC_LOOKUP_CACHE = false;
     *   }
     *   ```
     *
     * With the above code, `MyUncachedLazyJsonMapper` (and anything extending
     * from it) would run without using the magic function translation cache,
     * which means that all magic "virtual function" calls on instances of that
     * class would have to redo their property translations every time.
     *
     * @var bool
     */
    const USE_MAGIC_LOOKUP_CACHE = true;

    /**
     * Tells us how to map JSON properties to internal PHP types or objects.
     *
     * This constant can be overridden in your subclasses, to add custom JSON
     * mapping definitions to your class. It is recommended to always do so.
     *
     * The value must be an array of key-value pairs, where the key is the name
     * of a JSON property and the value is a string with the definition for that
     * specific property in PHPdoc-style. We will then perform automatic, strict
     * lazy-conversion of the value to the target type whenever you access that
     * property. (However, be aware that we always allow `NULL` values in any
     * property, and will never enforce/convert those to the target type.)
     *
     * The following built-in types are supported: `bool`, `int`, `float`,
     * `string`. The JSON data will be type-converted to match that type.
     *
     * Note that if the type is set to `mixed` or an empty string `""` instead,
     * then the property will allow any of the built-in types (`bool`, `int`,
     * `float`, `string`, `NULL` (as always) and multi-level arrays of any of
     * those types). There simply won't be any "forced" type-conversion to any
     * specific basic type for that property since you haven't defined any
     * strict type.
     *
     * Setting up untyped properties is still useful even if you don't know its
     * type, since defining the property in the class map ensures that you can
     * always get/set/access/use that property even if it's unavailable in the
     * current object instance's internal JSON data.
     *
     * You can also map values to objects. In the case of objects (classes), the
     * classes MUST inherit from `LazyJsonMapper` so they support all necessary
     * mapping features. To assign a class to a property, you can either write a
     * FULL (global) class path starting with a leading backslash `\`, such as
     * `\Foo\Bar\Baz`. Alternatively, you can use a RELATIVE path related to the
     * namespace of the CURRENT MAP'S class, such as `Bar\Baz` (if your current
     * class is `\Foo\Whatever`, then it'd be interpreted as `\Foo\Bar\Baz`).
     * Anything that DOESN'T start with a leading backslash is interpreted as a
     * relative class path! Just be aware that your class `use`-statements are
     * completely ignored since PHP has no mechanism to let us detect those.
     *
     * It's also possible to map properties to the core `LazyJsonMapper` object
     * if you simply want an object-oriented container for its data without
     * writing a custom class. You can do that by defining the property type as
     * either `\LazyJsonMapper\LazyJsonMapper`, or as `LazyJsonMapper` (which is
     * a special shortcut that ALWAYS resolves to the core class). But it's
     * always best to write a proper class, so that its properties are reliable.
     *
     * Lastly, you can map "arrays of TYPE" as well. Simply add one or more `[]`
     * brackets to the end of the type. For example, `int[]` means "array of
     * ints", and `\Foo[][][]` means "array of arrays of arrays of `\Foo`
     * objects". It may be easier to understand those mentally if you read them
     * backwards and say the words "array of" every time you see a `[]` bracket.
     * (Note: You can also use the array notation with `mixed[][]`, which would
     * then strictly define that the value MUST be mixed data at an exact depth
     * of 2 arrays, and that no further arrays are allowed deeper than that.)
     *
     * The assigned types and array-depths are STRICTLY validated. That's an
     * integral part of the `LazyJsonMapper` container, since it guarantees your
     * class property map interface will be strictly followed, and that you can
     * fully TRUST the data you're interacting with. If your map says that the
     * array data is at depth 8 and consists of `YourObject` objects, then we'll
     * make sure the data is indeed at depth 8 and their value type is correct!
     *
     * That goes for arrays too. If you define an `int[]` array of ints, then
     * we'll ensure that the array has sequential numeric keys starting at 0 and
     * going up without any gaps, exactly as a JSON array is supposed to be. And
     * if you define an object `YourObject`, then we'll ensure that the input
     * JSON data consists of an array with associative keys there (which is used
     * as the object properties), exactly as a JSON object is supposed to be.
     *
     * In other words, you can TOTALLY trust your data if you've assigned types!
     *
     * Example property map:
     *
     * ```php
     * const JSON_PROPERTY_MAP = [
     *     'some_string'              => 'string',
     *     'an_object'                => '\YourProject\YourObject',
     *     'array_of_numbers'         => 'int[]',
     *     'array_of_objects'         => 'RelativeObject[]',
     *     'untyped_value'            => '', // shorthand for 'mixed' below:
     *     'another_untyped_value'    => 'mixed', // allows multilevel arrays
     *     'deep_arr_of_arrs_of_int'  => 'int[][]',
     *     'array_of_mixed'           => 'mixed[]', // enforces 1-level depth
     *     'array_of_generic_objects' => 'LazyJsonMapper[]',
     * ];
     * ```
     *
     * Also note that we automatically inherit all of the class maps from all
     * parents higher up in your object-inheritance chain. In case of a property
     * name clash, the deepest child class definition of it takes precedence.
     *
     * It is also worth knowing that we support a special "multiple inheritance"
     * instruction which allows you to "import the map" from one or more other
     * classes. The imported maps will be merged onto your current class, as if
     * the entire hierarchy of properties from the target class (including the
     * target class' inherited parents and own imports) had been "pasted inside"
     * your class' property map at that point. And you don't have to worry
     * about carefully writing your inheritance relationships, because we have
     * full protection against circular references (when two objects try to
     * import each other) and will safely detect that issue at runtime whenever
     * we try to compile the maps of either of those bad classes with their
     * badly written imports.
     *
     * The instruction for importing other maps is very simple: You just have to
     * add an unkeyed array element with a reference to the other class. The
     * other class must simply refer to the relative or full path of the class,
     * followed by `::class`.
     *
     * Example of importing one or more maps from other classes:
     *
     * ```php
     * const JSON_PROPERTY_MAP = [
     *     'my_own_prop'                     => 'string',
     *     OtherClass::class,                // relative class path
     *     'redefined_prop'                  => float,
     *     \OtherNamespace\SomeClass::class, // full class path
     * ];
     * ```
     *
     * The imports are resolved in the exact order they're listed in the array.
     * Any property name clashes will always choose the version from the latest
     * statement in the list. So in this example, our class would first inherit
     * all of its own parent (`extends`) class maps. Then it would add/overwrite
     * `my_own_prop`. Then it imports everything from `OtherClass` (and its
     * parents/imports). Then it adds/overwrites `redefined_prop` (useful if you
     * want to re-define some property that was inherited from the other class).
     * And lastly, it imports everything from `\OtherNamespace\SomeClass` (and
     * its parents/imports). As long as there are no circular references,
     * everything will compile successfully and you will end up with a very
     * advanced final map! And any other class which later inherits from
     * (extends) or imports YOUR class will inherit the same advanced map from
     * you! This is REAL "multiple inheritance"! ;-)
     *
     * Also note that "relative class path" properties are properly inherited as
     * pointing to whatever was relative to the original inherited/imported
     * class where the property was defined. You don't have to worry about that.
     *
     * The only thing you should keep in mind is that we ONLY import the maps.
     * We do NOT import any functions from the imported classes (such as its
     * overridden functions), since there's no way for us to affect how PHP
     * resolves function calls to "copy" functions from one class to another. If
     * you need their functions, then you should simply `extends` from the class
     * to get true PHP inheritance instead of only importing its map. Or you
     * could just simply put your functions in PHP Traits and Interfaces so
     * that they can be re-used by various classes without needing inheritance!
     *
     * Lastly, here's an important general note about imports and inheritance:
     * You DON'T have to worry about "increased memory usage" when importing or
     * inheriting tons of other classes. The runtime "map compiler" is extremely
     * efficient and re-uses the already-compiled properties inherited from its
     * parents/imports, meaning that property inheritance is a ZERO-COST memory
     * operation! In fact, re-definitions are also zero-cost as long as your
     * class re-defines a property to the exact same type that it had already
     * inherited/imported. Such as `Base: foo:string, Child: foo:string`. In
     * that case, we detect that the definitions are identical and just re-use
     * the compiled property from `Base` instead. It's only when a class adds
     * NEW/MODIFIED properties that memory usage increases a little bit! In
     * other words, inheritance/imports are a very good thing, and are always a
     * better idea than manually writing similar lists of properties in various
     * unrelated (not extending each other) classes. In fact, if you have a
     * situation where many classes need similar properties, then it's a GREAT
     * idea to create special re-usable "property collection" classes and then
     * simply importing THOSE into ALL of the different classes that need those
     * sets of properties! You can even use that technique to get around PHP's
     * `use`-statement limitations (simply place a "property collection" class
     * container in the namespace that had all of your `use`-classes, and define
     * its properties via easy, relative paths there, and then simply make your
     * other classes import THAT container to get all of its properties).
     *
     * As you can see, the mapping and inheritance system is extremely powerful!
     *
     * Note that the property maps are analyzed and compiled at runtime, the
     * first time we encounter each class. After compilation, the compiled maps
     * become immutable (cannot be modified). So there's no point trying to
     * modify this variable at runtime. That's also partially the reason why
     * this is defined through a constant, since they prevent you from modifying
     * the array at runtime and you believing that it would update your map. The
     * compiled maps are immutable at runtime for performance & safety reasons!
     *

     *
     * You CANNOT override this constructor. That's because the constructor and
     * its arguments and exact algorithm are too important to allow subclasses
     * to risk breaking it (especially since you must then perfectly maintain an
     * identical constructor argument list and types of thrown exceptions, and
     * would always have to remember to call our constructor first, and so on).
     *
     * Furthermore, trying to have custom constructors on "JSON data container
     * objects" MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL, since your JSON data objects can be
     * created recursively and automatically from nested JSON object data. So
     * there's no way you could run your object's custom constructors then!
     *
     * Instead, there is a separate `_init()` function which you can override in
     * your subclasses, for safe custom initialization. And if you NEED to use
     * some external variables in certain functions in your JSON data classes,
     * then simply add those variables as arguments to those class-functions!
     *
     * Also note that there are many reasons why the JSON data must be provided
     * as an array instead of as an object. Most importantly, the memory usage
     * is much lower if you decode to an array (because a \stdClass requires as
     * much RAM as an array WITH object overhead ON TOP of that), and also
     * because the processing we do is more efficient when we have an array.
     *
     * Lastly, this seems like a prominent enough place to mention something
     * that's VERY important if you are handling JSON data on 32-bit systems:
     * PHP running as a 32-bit process does NOT support 64-bit JSON integers
     * natively. It will cast them to floats instead, which may lose precision,
     * and fails completely if you then cast those numbers to strings, since you
     * will get float notation or `INT_MAX` capping depending on what you are
     * doing with the data (ie `printf('%d')` would give `INT_MAX`, and `%s`
     * would give scientific notation like `8.472E+22`). All of those situations
     * can be avoided by simply telling PHP to decode big numbers to strings:
     *
     *   ```php
     *   json_decode($json, true, 512, JSON_BIGINT_AS_STRING);
     *   ```
     *
     * If you are ever going to handle 64-bit integers on 32-bit systems, then
     * you will NEED to do the above, as well as ensuring that all of your class
     * `JSON_PROPERTY_MAP` definitions never use any `int` field type (since
     * that would convert the safe strings back into truncated 32-bit integers).
     * Instead, you should define those fields as `string`-type in your map.

     * Initializer for custom subclass construction / data updates.
     *
     * This is where you can perform your custom subclass initialization, since
     * you are unable to override the main constructor.
     *
     * We automatically run this function at the end of the normal constructor,
     * as well as every time that you manually use `assignObjectData()` to
     * replace the object's data. (When new data is assigned, you should treat
     * yourself as a new object, which is why `_init()` will run again.)
     *
     * `WARNING:` Please RESIST the urge to touch ANY of the internal JSON data
     * during this initialization. All data will always be automatically
     * validated during actual retrieval and setting, so you can always trust
     * that the final types WILL match your class property map definitions.
     *
     * Remember that any extra work you do in `_init()` will run EVERY time an
     * instance of your object is created, even when those objects live within a
     * main object. So if your function is heavy, it will slow down operation of
     * the class; and your parsing of the properties would be counter-productive
     * against the goal of "lazy parsing" of JSON data on a when-accessed basis!
     *
     * Instead, it's preferable to just override specific property getter and
     * setter functions, to make your class return different default values if a
     * certain internal data field is missing an expected value. But in general,
     * your ultimate USER CODE should be responsible for most of THAT checking,
     * by simply looking for `NULL` (denoting a missing value in the JSON data
     * container), and then deciding what to do with that in your final project.
     *
     * Lastly, there are a few rules that MUST be followed by your `_init()`:
     *
     *  1. As explained above, but worth repeating again: Your `LazyJsonMapper`
     *  classes are supposed to be LIGHT-weight "JSON data containers". So
     *  please DO NOT treat this as a "standard class constructor". The more
     *  work you do in `_init()`, the slower your object creation is. And since
     *  your object is a JSON container which is automatically created from
     *  data, you can expect LOTS of instances of your class to be created
     *  during normal runtime! That's also why your `_init()` function does not
     *  get any parameters! That is to discourage misuse as a normal class.
     *
     *  Also remember that you may not even need `_init()`, since you can simply
     *  give your properties default values instead of using `_init()`, such as
     *  by writing `public $myproperty = true;`. All instances of that object
     *  would then start with that value set to `TRUE` by default.
     *
     *  2. You can ONLY throw `LazyUserException`. All other exceptions will be
     *  blocked and turned into a generic `LazyUserException`. This is done to
     *  ensure that your custom init function cannot break the contract that the
     *  `LazyJsonMapper` constructor guarantees in its listed exceptions.
     *
     *  (That's also the reason why all built-in functions except `_init()` are
     *  marked `final`: So that subclasses cannot break the `LazyJsonMapper`
     *  API/interface contract. If something IS a `LazyJsonMapper`, it MUST
     *  behave as a `LazyJsonMapper`, and the `final` functions guarantee that!)
     *
     *  3. If your class extends from `LazyJsonMapper`, then there's no need to
     *  call `parent::_init()` (since our core `_init()` does nothing). But if
     *  you extend from ANY OTHER CLASS, you MUST call your parent's init BEFORE
     *  doing any work, just to guarantee that your WHOLE parent-class hierarchy
     *  is fully initialized first.
     *
     *  4. Understand and accept the fact that your personal class properties
     *  will NOT be serialized if you serialize an object. Only the JSON data
     *  array will be kept. The `_init()` function will be called again when you
     *  unserialize the object data, as if your object had just been created for
     *  the first time. This is done to save space and to discourage misuse
     *  of your `LazyJsonMapper` containers.
     *
     *  Remember that your classes are supposed to be lightweight JSON data
     *  containers, which give you a strongly typed, automatic, object-oriented
     *  interface to your data. Classes "with advanced constructors and tons of
     *  properties" are NOT suitable as JSON containers and belong ELSEWHERE in
     *  the rest of your project!
     *
     * @throws LazyUserException If there is any fatal error which prevents
     *                           initialization. This stops object construction
     *                           if this is the initial construction. However,

     * Such properties are dangerous, since they only exist in the current data.

     * use absolute/global paths (ie `\Foo\Bar\Baz`), or whether they should use
     * paths relative to the class they are owned by (ie `Baz`) when possible.
     * And that's ONLY possible whenever the target type lives within the same
     * namespace as the class. Any properties from other namespaces will still
     * use absolute paths.

     * Get a processed copy of this object instance's internal data contents.
     *
     * It is recommended that you save the result if you intend to re-use it
     * multiple times, since each call to this function will need to perform
     * copying and data conversion from our internal object representation.
     *
     * Note that the conversion process will recursively validate and convert
     * all properties in the entire internal data hierarchy. You can trust that
     * the returned result will be perfectly accurate and follow your class map
     * property type-rules. This does however mean that the data may not be the
     * same as the input array you gave to `__construct()`. For example, if your
     * input contained an array `["1", "2"]` and your type definition map says
     * that you want `int` for that property, then you'd get `[1, 2]` as output.
     *
     * The conversion is always done on a temporary COPY of the internal data,
     * which means that you're welcome to run this function as much as you want
     * without causing your object to grow from resolving all its sub-objects.
     *
     * It also means the returned copy belongs to YOU, and that you're able to
     * do ANYTHING with it, without risk of affecting any of OUR internal data.
     *
     * `WARNING:` If you intend to use the result to `json_encode()` a new JSON
     * object then please DON'T do that. Look at `asJson()` instead, which gives
     * you full control over all JSON output parameters and properly handles the
     * conversion in all scenarios, without you needing to do any manual work.

     * handy shortcuts instead of manually having to call this longer function.

     * Analyze the entire object and check for undefined or bad JSON properties.
     *
     * This lets you analyze the object data & map to look for the following:
     *
     *  1. Undefined JSON properties that need to be defined in your classes
     *  so that their existence becomes permanent and therefore safer to use
     *  (since defined properties are always retrievable even if they don't
     *  exist in the current object instance's data). And actually defining
     *  the properties is also the ONLY way that you can enforce a specific
     *  data-type, since undefined properties default to untyped (`mixed`).
     *
     *  2. Bad class map definitions that don't match the actual JSON data.
     *  It does this by checking all of the encountered classes within the JSON
     *  data to ensure that they construct successfully (which they ALWAYS
     *  will, unless the user has overridden `_init()` and throws from it), as
     *  well as verifying that all basic PHP type coercions work, and that the
     *  data is formatted as-described in the definition (such as having the
     *  correct array-depth, or data defined as objects actually being objects).
     *
     * The scan is performed by looking at EVERY item in the object's internal
     * JSON data array, and checking for a corresponding class map definition
     * (if nothing exists, it's treated as "missing from the class map"), and
     * then attempting conversion to its specified type (if that fails, it's
     * treated as "bad class map definition"). All undefined values (which lack
     * any class map definition) are ALSO validated as if they were `mixed`,
     * to ensure that NOTHING can contain illegal values.
     *
     * If a recursive scan is requested, then all sub-objects (`LazyJsonMapper`
     * data containers) will ALSO recursively perform the same analysis on their
     * own internal data, so that the whole JSON data tree is recursively
     * verified. Their analysis results will be merged with our return value.
     *
     * Note that calling this function will cause the WHOLE object tree to be
     * constructed and ALL of its mapped properties to be converted/parsed to
     * verify the class map, which takes some time and permanently increases the
     * object's memory usage (since conversion causes any internal sub-objects
     * to be stored as actual objects instead of merely as plain sub-arrays)!
     *
     * Therefore, you should ONLY use this function when necessary: When you
     * need advanced and powerful debugging of your class maps!

     * Get the value of an object data property.
     *
     * This function automatically reads the object instance's data and converts
     * the value to the correct type on-the-fly. If that part of the data-array
     * is an object, it will be lazy-created the first time it's requested.
     *
     * `NOTE:` If the object instance's internal data doesn't contain a value, but
     * it's listed in the class property definition, then it will be treated as
     * missing and `NULL` will automatically be returned instead. However, if
     * it's missing from the class definition AND the object instance's data,
     * then it's treated as an invalid property and an exception is thrown.
     *
     * Because of the fact that the default return value for internally-missing
     * but "class-valid" properties is `NULL`, it means that you cannot discern
     * whether the `NULL` came from actual JSON data or from the default return
     * value. However, if that distinction matters to you, you should simply
     * call `_hasPropertyData()` before retrieving the value.
     *
     * `IMPORTANT:` This function performs return-by-reference, which was done
     * in order to allow certain ADVANCED programming tricks by the caller. If
     * you save our return value by reference, you'll then have a direct link to
     * the internal data for that property and can write directly to it
     * (including writing invalid data if you want to, since we cannot verify
     * what you do with your reference). However, you A) don't have to worry
     * about invalid data, because it will all get validated at the next
     * `_getProperty()` call again, and B) you have to explicitly bind the
     * returned value by reference to actually risk affecting the internal
     * data, as explained below.
     *
     * Method 1 (recommended for almost 100% of all usages, safest):
     *
     *  ```php
     *  $val = $this->_getProperty('foo'); // Copy-on-write assignment to $val.
     *  $val = 'bar'; // Does NOT modify the internal data "foo" property.
     *  ```
     *
     * Method 2 (dangerous, and this example even contains an intentional bug):
     *
     *  ```php
     *  $val = &$this->_getProperty('foo'); // Reference assignment to $val.
     *  $val = 'bar'; // Direct link, thus modifies the internal "foo" property.
     *  ```
     *
     * `SERIOUS WARNING:` If you use Method 2, do NOT use the code above. It was
     * just explained that way to demonstrate a SERIOUS MISTAKE. If you assign
     * by reference, you obviously intend to link directly to internal data. But
     * the code above fails if no internal data for that property exists yet. In
     * that case, the code above will write to a temporary `NULL` variable which
     * is not linked at all to the object. Instead, you MUST ALWAYS use
     * `$createMissingValue = true` if you want TRUSTABLE data references.
     *
     * Method 2 (the CORRECT way of writing it):
     *
     *  ```php
     *  $val = &$this->_getProperty('foo', true);
     *  $val = 'bar';
     *  ```
     *
     * That FIXED code will create the property and put `NULL` in it if it's
     * missing from the internal data, and then returns the reference to the
     * created internal data entry. It's the ONLY way to ensure REAL references.
     *
     * Note that there is ZERO PERFORMANCE BENEFIT of assigning our return-value
     * by reference. ONLY use references if you have an ADVANCED reason for it!
     * Internally, PHP treats both assignment types identically until the moment
     * you try to write to/modify the contents of the variable. So if you are
     * only reading, which is most of the time, then there's no reason to use a
     * reference. And never forget that modifying via direct reference lets you
     * write invalid data (which won't be detected until a `_getProperty()`
     * call attempts to read that bad data again), as mentioned earlier.
     *
     * There is one final warning: If YOU have a "return-by-reference" function,
     * then you will AUTOMATICALLY return a direct link to the inner data if you
     * use us directly in your return statement. Here's an example of that:
     *
     *  ```php
     *  public function &myFunction() { // <-- Note the "&" return-by-ref here!
     *      // returns reference to real internal data OR temp var (badly coded)
     *      return $this->_getProperty('foo'); // <-- VERY DANGEROUS BUG!
     *
     *      // returns reference to real internal data (correctly coded)
     *      return $this->_getProperty('foo', true); // <-- CORRECT!
     *
     *      // you can also intentionally break the link to the internal data,
     *      // by putting it in a copy-on-write variable and returning THAT:
     *      $copyOnWrite = $this->_getProperty('foo'); // copy-on-write (no ref)
     *      return $copyOnWrite; // ref to $copyOnWrite but not to real internal
     *  }
     *  ```
     *
     * @param string $propName           The property name.
     * @param bool   $createMissingValue If `TRUE` then we will create missing
     *                                   internal object data entries (for
     *                                   class-defined properties) and store a
     *                                   `NULL` in them. This will "pollute" the
     *                                   internal data with default `NULL`s for
     *                                   every missing property that you attempt
     *                                   to retrieve, but it's totally NECESSARY
     *                                   if you intend to use the return-value
     *                                   by-reference, since we MUST store the

    /**
     * __GET is invoked when reading data from inaccessible properties.
     *
     * This magic handler takes care of "virtual property" access to the
     * object's JSON data properties.
     *
     * `WARNING:` Note that the `__get()` "virtual property" handling creates
     * `NULL` values in any missing (but valid in class-map) properties that you
     * try to access! That is NECESSARY because PHP EXPECTS the `__get()` return
     * value to be a REFERENCE to real internal data, so we MUST create a value
     * if no value exists, so that we can link PHP to a true reference to the
     * internal data. Obviously we can't link to something that doesn't exist,
     * which is why we MUST create `NULL` values. Unfortunately that means that
     * "virtual property access" will lead to increased memory usage and worse
     * JSON output (due to all the added values) if you want to export the
     * internal data as JSON later.
     *
     * The recommended access method, `$obj->getFoo()` ("virtual functions")
     * doesn't have that problem. It ONLY happens when you decide to use
     * `$obj->foo` for "direct virtual property" access.
     *
     * There are several other quirks with "direct virtual properties", due to
     * how PHP works. If you don't write your code carefully, you may cause
     * serious issues with performance or unexpected results.
     *
     * All of the important quirks are as follows:
     *
     *  1. The aforementioned necessary `NULL` value insertion increases memory
     *  usage and may lead to unexpected problems if you convert back to JSON,
     *  such as if the server does not expect those values to exist with `NULL`.
     *
     *  2. Anytime you use the array `[]` access operator on the outer property
     *  name, PHP will trigger a `__get()` call, which of course does its whole
     *  data-validation again. The following would therefore be EXTREMELY SLOW,
     *  and possibly even DANGEROUS (since you're manipulating the array while
     *  looping over its keys while constantly triggering `__get()` re-parsing):
     *
     *    ```php
     *    foreach ($obj->something as $k => $v) {
     *        // Every assignment here will do __get('something') which parses
     *        // the array over and over again before each element is modified:
     *        $obj->something[$k] = 'foo';
     *    }
     *    ```
     *
     *  The proper way to solve THAT is to either save a reference to
     *  `$obj->something` as follows:
     *
     *    ```php
     *    $ref = &$obj->something; // Calls __get('something') a single time.
     *    foreach ($ref as $k => $v) {
     *        $ref[$k] = 'foo'; // Changes array directly via stored reference.
     *    }
     *    ```
     *
     *  Or to loop through the input values as follows:
     *
     *    ```php
     *    foreach ($obj->something as &$v) { // Note the "&" symbol.
     *        $v = 'foo'; // Changes array value directly via reference.
     *    }
     *    ```
     *
     *  3. Anytime you use a reference, there will be NO DATA VALIDATION of the
     *  new value you are inputting. It will not be checked again UNTIL the next
     *  internal `_getProperty()` call for that property (ie. by the next
     *  `__get()`) so you may therefore unintentionally insert bad data that
     *  doesn't match the class definition map:
     *
     *    ```php
     *    // Saving a reference to internal data and then changing that variable
     *    // will directly edit the value without letting us validate it:
     *
     *    $ref = &$obj->some_string; // Make "$ref" into a reference to data.
     *    $ref = new InvalidObject(); // Writes a bad value directly to memory.
     *    var_dump($obj->some_string); // Throws error because of bad data.
     *
     *    // The same is true about array access. In this case, PHP does
     *    // __get('some_int_array') and finds an array, and then it directly
     *    // manipulates that array's memory without letting us validate it:
     *
     *    $obj->some_int_array[] = new InvalidObject();
     *    $obj->some_int_array[15] = new InvalidObject();
     *    var_dump($obj->some_int_array); // Throws error because of bad data.
     *    ```
     *
     *  4. You can always trust that `__set()` assignments WILL be validated.
     *  But a `__set()` ONLY happens when you assign with the equals operator
     *  (`=`) to a pure property name WITHOUT any array access (`[]`) operators.
     *
     *    ```php
     *    $obj->some_property = '123'; // Calls __set() and validates new value.
     *    $obj->an_array[] = '123' // Calls __get() and won't validate changes.
     *    ```
     *
     * These quirks of "virtual direct property access" are quite easy to deal
     * with when you know about them, since almost all of them are about array
     * access, and the rest are about intentional misuse by binding directly to
     * references. Just avoid making those mistakes.
     *
     * However, in general, you should REALLY be using the "virtual function"
     * access method instead, which allows you to do great things such as
     * overriding certain class property-functions (ie `getSomething()`) with
     * your own custom behaviors, so that you can do extra validation, get/set
     * value transformations, and other fantastic things!
     *
     * It is possible (and recommended) to disable virtual properties via the
     * `ALLOW_VIRTUAL_PROPERTIES` class constant. The feature is only enabled by
     * default because it helps people easily migrate from legacy projects.

     * later, regardless of what was in your internal data property storage.
     *
     * Also note that only the internal JSON data is serialized. We will not
     * serialize any subclass `$properties`, since that would be a misuse of how
     * your `LazyJsonMapper` subclasses are supposed to be designed. If they
     * need custom properties, then you can handle those in `_init()` as usual.
     *
     * Lastly, you should know that calling `serialize()` will not disrupt any
     * internal data of the current object instance that you're serializing.
     * You can therefore continue to work with the object afterwards, or even
     * `serialize()` the same instance multiple times.

     * Called during unserialization of the object.
     *
     * You are not supposed to call this directly. Instead, use PHP's global
     * `unserialize()` call:
     *
     * ```php
     * $restoredObj = unserialize($savedStr);
     * ```
     *
     * This unserializer is thin and efficient. It simply unpacks the serialized
     * raw data array and uses it as the new object's data, without validating
     * any of the actual values within the serialized data array. It's intended
     * to get the new object into the same JSON data state as the serialized
     * object, which is why we don't re-analyze the data after unserialization.
     *
     * Note that the unserialization will call the constructor, with a single
     * argument (your unserialized JSON data array). Everything that the default
     * constructor performs will happen during unserialization, EXACTLY as if
     * you had created a brand new object and given it the data array directly.
     *
     * You can therefore fully trust your unserialized objects as much as you
     * already trust your manually created ones! And you can even store them
     * somewhere and then unserialize them at any time in the future, during a
     * completely separate PHP process, and even years from now as long as your
     * project still contains the specific (sub)-class that you originally
     * serialized. Have fun!
     *
     * @param string $serialized The string representation of the object.
     *
     * @throws LazySerializationException If the raw, serialized data cannot be
     *                                    unserialized at all.
     * @throws LazyJsonMapperException    If there are any problems creating the
     *                                    class that you are unserializing. See
     *                                    the regular constructor for error
     *                                    reasons, but disregard all of its data
     *                                    validation reasons, since unserialized
     *                                    JSON data is not validated (analyzed)
     *                                    when it reaches the constructor. The
     *                                    most likely reasons why this exception
     *                                    would be thrown during `unserialize()`
     *                                    is that your class property map is
     *                                    invalid and could not be compiled, and
     *                                    thus the object couldn't be recreated,
     *                                    OR that a custom `_init()` threw.

     * class constants and can NEVER be modified at runtime (not even via PHP
     * 7.1's advanced `ReflectionClassConstant` class).
