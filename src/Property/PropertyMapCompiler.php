     * Compiles the JSON property map for a class (incl. class inheritance).
     *
     * Parses the entire chain of own, inherited and imported JSON property maps
     * for the given class, and validates all definitions in the entire map.
     *
     * Each class definition is only resolved and parsed a single time; the
     * first time we encounter it. From then on, it is stored in the cache so
     * that object creations can instantly link to their compiled map. And so
     * any other classes which rely on that class can instantly re-use its map.
     *
     * And all maps are built hierarchically, starting with their base class.
     * Every sub-object which extends that object re-uses its parent's compiled
     * PropertyDefinition objects, to reduce the memory requirements even more.
     * The same is true for any imported maps via the import mechanism.
     *
     * As an additional layer of protection, ALL properties (in the current
     * class and its extends/import-hierarchy) that point to uncompiled classes
     * will ALSO be verified and compiled, to ensure that THEIR class property
     * maps compile successfully. And it will happen recursively until all
     * linked classes (inheritance, imports and property links) have been fully
     * compiled throughout the entire linked hierarchy. It ensures that users
     * will be able to FULLY trust that EVERY property in their class and its
     * ENTIRE tree of related classes are pointing at classes that have been
     * successfully compiled and are known to work and are ready for reliable
     * use at runtime.
     *
     * That extra protection does however also mean that your runtime's initial
     * compile-calls will take the longest, since they'll spider-crawl the
     * ENTIRE hierarchy of extends, imports, and ALL properties of each, and
     * then ALL extends and imports and properties of the classes pointed to by
     * those properties, and so on... But despite all of that extra work, it's
     * STILL blazingly FAST at compiling, and the extra security is well worth
     * it! And as soon as all relevant maps are compiled during your current
     * runtime, this function won't have to do any work anymore! Then you can
     * just relax and fully trust that all of your class maps are perfect! :-)
     *
     * If there are ANY compilation problems, then an automatic rollback takes
     * place which restores the `PropertyMapCache` to its original pre-call
     * state.
     *
     * This compiler algorithm provides perfect peace of mind. If it doesn't

     * compiled and is ready for use in your cache!

        // process. Only the root function call is allowed to resolve PROPERTY
        // references to other classes and ensure that THOSE maps are
        // successfully are compiled too. Otherwise we'd run into circular
        // compilation issues where properties fail to compile because they may
        // be pointing at things which are not compiled yet (such as a class

        // that points to class "B" which has a property that points to class
        // "C" which has a property that points back at class "A" and therefore
        // would cause a circular reference if we'd tried to compile those
        // property-classes instantly as-they're encountered). We must therefore
        // defer property-class compilation until ALL core classes in the
        // current inheritance/import chain are resolved. THEN it's safe to
        // begin compiling any other encountered classes from the properties...
        //
        // The solution is "simple": Build a list of the class-paths of all
        // encountered UNCOMPILED property classes within our own map tree and
        // within any imports (which are done via recursive compile-calls). To
        // handle imports, we simply ensure that our compile-function (this one)
        // lets the parent retrieve our list of "encountered uncompiled classes
        // from properties" so that we'll let it bubble up all the way to the
        // root class/call that began the whole compile-chain. And then just let
        // that root-level call resolve ALL uncompiled properties from the
        // ENTIRE tree by simply compiling the list of property-classes one by
        // one if they're still missing. That way, we'll get full protection
        // against uncompilable class-properties ANYWHERE in our tree, and we'll
        // do it at a totally safe time (at the end of the main compilation call
        // that kicked everything off)!
        //
        // NOTE: As an optimization, to avoid constant array-writes and the
        // creation of huge and rapidly growing "encountered classes" arrays, we
        // will attempt to ONLY track the encountered classes that are MISSING
        // from the cache (not yet compiled). And this list will ALSO be checked
        // one more time at the end, to truly clear everything that's already
        // done. That's intended to make the list as light-weight as possible
        // so that our parent-compiler doesn't have to do heavy lifting.

        // inheritance hierarchy and sees nothing locked (LazyJsonMapper is
        // unlocked because it's already done, and B is unlocked because B has
        // not locked itself yet). Next, "B" sees an "import A" statement. It
        // succeeds the "block import of A if it's part of our own hierarchy"
        // check above, since B is NOT "extended from A".
        //

        // we don't know it yet. We COULD let it proceed to "resolve A by
        // sub-compiling the map for A", which would give us a call-stack of
        // "compile A -> compile B -> compile A", but then the 2nd "A" compiler
